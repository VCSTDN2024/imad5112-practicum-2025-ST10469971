App purpose and Features 

Purpose: 

The main goal of this app is for the user to store song details and allow the user to create and manage their playlists.  

 

Key Features: 

Feature 1: “Add to playlist button” is where the user clicks to be able to input the song details. 

Feature 2: “Song rating” between the numbers 1-5 must be entered by the user depending on their preferences of the song. 

Feature 3: “Next Button” proceeds to the next screen. 

Feature 4: "Song details” space that will show the details of the app generated by the app. 

Feature 5: “Calculate Average button” calculates the average of the ratings input by the user. 

Feature 6: “Exit button” used to exit the program once the button is clicked on 

These features aim to provide quick and easy meal suggestions for people with busy schedules. 

Design Considerations  

The design of the flashcard app was based on the following considerations:  

User Experience (UX): The app was designed with the goal of providing an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.  

Responsiveness: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility.  

Simplicity: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.  

Performance: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage.  

Why:  

GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization  

GitHub and GitHub Actions  

This project was managed using GitHub for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.  

GitHub Actions:  

I utilized I utilized CI/CD action to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:  

Running automated tests to ensure the app’s functionality.  

Compiling the app into APK and AAB files, which are the formats that are required for distribution.  

I uploaded these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access. The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

hallenge 1: “Connecting a device to Android Studio”  

Solution:” I connected the BlueStacks app to my android device and made sure it was connected on the run for BlueStacks application”   

Challenge 2: “Pushing my work from Android Studio to GitHub”  

 

Solution: “I used the Command Prompt and executed the commands that managed to push my work to GitHub”  

 

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions  

 

8.  Future Enhancements   

 While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:  

 

Feature 1: "Current date and time shown at the top”  

Feature 2: “Adding a different picture in the background to attract the user 

Feature 3: “adding more questions to the app”  

These enhancements would improve the app’s usability and make it even more versatile for end-users.
